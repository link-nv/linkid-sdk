     * @param applicationKeyPair      The application's key pair that will be used to sign the authentication request.
     * @param applicationCertificate  The certificate issued for the application's key pair.  It will be added to WS-Security headers for
     *                                purpose of server-side identification and verification.
     * @param trustedCertificates     Used for validating whether incoming messages can be trusted.  The certificate chain in the incoming
     *                                message's signature is deemed trusted when the chain is valid, all certificates are valid, none are

     *                                communication with the server. May be {@code null}, in which case no SSL certificate validation

     * @param themeName               The name of the theme configured at the linkID node that should be applied to the linkID

     * @param devices                 A set of devices with which the user is allowed to authenticate himself.  Any devices that are not in

     *                                allowed!

     * @param protocol                The protocol to use for the communication between the application and the linkID services.  May be
